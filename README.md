# GotPS
First Growtopia Private Server using Go. Based on [eikarna/gotops](https://github.com/eikarna/gotops)

# Known Issues
- Go is hard for OOP (Object-Oriented-Programming), many data types from normal GTPS Source may can't be implemented in this Project.
- This Project based on [eikarna/gotops](https://github.com/eikarna/gotops), which use the cgo for communicate to ENet library, and the performance is up to you.
- I'am not GTPS Devs expert, so don't ask me about in-game packet in Growtopia.
- No Active Contributor rn.
